# Half-Life Alyx | Bad Kitty

A custom horror themed map / tutorial for Half-Life Alyx custom mapping.

This is my first ever Hammer map and was an exercise for me to learn some of the basics of custom Half-Life Alyx mapping utilizing Hammer and Source engine 2. 

This was 100% built using the "unofficial" Half-Life Alyx SDK script that I wrote, it's available here -> https://github.com/thenayr/Half-Life-Alyx-SDK

## Learn from this map
I designed this map as a "tutorial" of sorts in that I included the original source files for this map for you to learn from.  

Specifically I've included the following in my map:

- Triggers
- Sounds (ambient, triggered, etc)
- Particles
- Lights (spot, omni, realtime, baked)
- Physics
- Custom Panorama title

This covers quite a few of possibilities for creating a custom map of your own, so I hope you learn from it!

## Installation instructions

To play the map, drag the `game` folder into your REAL Half-Life Alyx installation directory, the layout should match what you have `Half-Life Alyx\game\hlvr\...`.

Open the console with `~` and type `map bad-kitty`.  

## Credits

None of this would have been possible without the help of https://github.com/gvarados1 and the countless people in the Half-Life Alyx modding discord - https://discord.gg/GpvWBg

Enjoy!
